Abstract

Early and accurate detection of maize-related illnesses is essential to ensuring food security and raising crop output. For large-scale applications, conventional disease detection methods such as manual visual inspections—are inefficient due to their laborious nature and error-proneness. Deep learning techniques have made it possible to identify plant diseases—particularly those that impact maize faster, more reliably, and more scalable. By utilizing cutting-edge deep learning structures 
to improve the accuracy of maize disease diagnosis, this study aims to raise agricultural productivity and reduce the risk of crop losses. transfer learning techniques to further improve the efficiency of the deep learning models. Which aims to assess the accuracy of different deep learning models in identifying illnesses in maize and explore the ways in which hyperparameter adjustment improves the model's performance.by analyzing five popular deep learning models' accuracy and show the effects of adjusting hyperparameters in order to discover the best architecture. This proposed work included five state-of-the-art deep learning models: EfficientNetB0, CNN, ResNeT101, Inceptionv3, and VGG16. Accuracy was utilized to evaluate each model's performance following training on a sizable dataset of photos depicting corn disease. Extensive hyperparameter tweaking was performed on EfficientNet, resulting in an accuracy of 95.55%. This tuning included changes to learning rates, batch sizes, and network depth. Additionally, the following models were trained and assessed: ResNeT101 (92.11%), Inceptionv3 (66.66%), CNN (99.33%), and VGG16 (89.84%). CNN out of the five models, fared the best, coming in second with 99.52%, and third with EfficientNet (95.33%) and ResNeT101 (92.11%). This suggests that CNNs are still quite beneficial in this kind of work. A tweak to a hyperparameter allowed EfficientNet to perform noticeably better than CNN, allowing it to close the performance gap. With an accuracy of 66.66%, Inceptionv3 performed poorly; on the other hand, VGG16 did rather well, achieving an accuracy of 89.84%). These results highlight the significance of selecting an appropriate model architecture and modifying hyperparameters to enhance maize disease detection performance. EfficientNet's hyperparameter tuning offers a unique method that might be used to other models to improve performance even more. The findings offer insightful information for deep learning's potential uses in agriculture, particularly in the identification of plant diseases.

Introduction 

The world's population is growing daily, and one of the main causes of this growth in food availability is agriculture. India's economy is mostly based on agriculture because a large number of people work as farmers in rural areas. One of the most often grown agricultural products in India and around the world is maize, sometimes known as corn. The Indian Institute of Maize Research (ICAR) states that maize is the most widely grown food crop in India, followed by rice and wheat. Most of these crops are cultivated in two seasons, the rainy and the winter, which together account for 80% of the total agricultural land. Consequently, India is ranked fourth among all the maize-growing nations Regarding area and seventh in terms of cultivation. In this nation, maize is utilized to feed animals as well as one of the essential nutrients for humans. Deep learning as a field has dominated image classification for the last few years. Consequently, the suggested model assists in identifying leaves with illnesses such as leaf spots, leaf blight, or leaf rust, and separates them into four groups: healthy leaves, diseased or unhealthy leaves, and diseased leaves.
A vital food crop for the world, maize is particularly susceptible to a number of illnesses that can have a negative effect on productivity and food security. In order to mitigate crop losses and maintain sustainable agricultural practices, early and precise disease identification is critical. Conventional techniques, including manual inspection, are frequently laborious, error-prone, and wasteful. Recent developments in deep learning have enabled automate the faster and more accurate diagnosis of plant diseases, which makes it a vital tool for contemporary agriculture. When used to address problems in agriculture, deep learning techniques have demonstrated enormous promise for using picture data to identify crop diseases. These models perform even better thanks to transfer learning and hyperparameter adjustment, which raises their accuracy in classification tests. Deep learning algorithms make it possible to monitor crops on a wide scale and in real time, which offers a revolutionary solution for managing diseases. Adopting this cutting-edge technology can result in notable advancements in crop health management and monitoring, which can enhance agricultural practices. Various studies have examined maize disease diagnosis using methods for machine learning and image processing. diseases that affect the leaves of maize, such as common rust, gray leaf spot, and northern leaf blight, are serious risks to crop productivity. Color transformation and picture segmentation are two early detection techniques that have shown promise in identifying sick leaves. 
A number of methods rely on separating the channels from the red and green image in order to improve feature recognition, and then converting the image to binary for segmentation. Deep network are one category of models for machine learning that have been used in research to identify healthy and sick maize leaves. While a lot of approaches seem promising, the problem is how to improve real-time applicability and detection accuracy in a variety of agricultural contexts. The improvement of maize productivity and the reduction of crop losses depend heavily on these initiatives [1]. Transfer learning combined with the deep network is used to identify illnesses in maize plants. It emphasizes how crucial early disease diagnosis is to maximizing crop production and minimizing losses. Since CNN excel in image classification tasks, which are been used to recognize the outward signs of illnesses like leaf rust and leaf blight in maize leaves. Reducing training time and increasing efficiency are achieved by applying One method is transfer learning. that involves tailoring a pre-trained model to a task. The study also uses data augmentation techniques to artificially increase the variety of training data, hence improving model robustness. The strategy highlights the use of cutting-edge precision farming with machine learning techniques, providing viable remedies for prompt disease identification in agriculture [2].
